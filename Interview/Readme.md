Azure DevOps Engineer – 3 Years Experience Self-Introduction

“Hi, I’m an Azure DevOps Engineer with around 3 years of experience specializing in CI/CD automation, infrastructure provisioning, and cloud-native deployments on Azure.

I have strong hands-on experience with Azure DevOps pipelines (YAML & Classic), Git, Docker, Kubernetes (AKS), Terraform, ARM/Bicep, and monitoring using Azure Monitor & Log Analytics. I’ve built end-to-end CI/CD pipelines for .NET, Java, and Python applications, automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, and implemented containerization strategies using Docker and AKS.

I’ve also worked on Azure services like App Services, Key Vault, Storage Accounts, Virtual Networks, ACR, and Application Insights. In my previous projects, I focused on improving deployment reliability, reducing manual efforts through automation scripts (PowerShell/Bash), and optimizing pipeline execution time.

Overall, I bring strong problem-solving, cloud automation, and DevOps best practices to ensure fast, secure, and scalable delivery.”
